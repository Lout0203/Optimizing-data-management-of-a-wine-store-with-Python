# Optimizing-data-management-of-a-wine-store-with-Python


In this project I carried out three missions:

I first reconciled two exports, an export from the ERP containing the product references, their selling price and their stock status and an export from a table from the CMS tool containing the information of the products marketed online. (name, description, number of sales...).

Then I calculated the turnover by product, as well as the turnover made online.

In addition, I performed a univariate analysis on the product price variable to detect possible outliers, in order to list them and make a graphical representation of them.
